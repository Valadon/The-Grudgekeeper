# Debugging Notes - Grid Display Issue

## Problem Summary
The game grid is not displaying correctly for the user, despite appearing correct in Puppeteer screenshots.

### User Reports:
1. Grid appears as a single vertical line (all characters stacked vertically)
2. A "strange block" appears to the right of the dwarf when moving
3. Room width appears incorrect (not 10 characters wide)
4. Initially the dwarf (@) was not green, but this is now fixed

### What Works:
- Player color is now green (fixed)
- Wall colors are gray (fixed)
- The grid data structure is correct (10x10 array)
- Puppeteer screenshots show it working correctly

### Key Discovery:
The debug script revealed that in the browser, the font was 'Times' instead of monospace, even though:
- We have `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Mono:wght@400;700&display=swap');` in globals.css
- We tried both Tailwind's `font-mono` class and explicit inline styles

### Attempts Made:
1. Used flexbox with spans - resulted in vertical stacking
2. Used CSS Grid - resulted in vertical stacking
3. Used pre tag with string building - partial success but spacing issues
4. Used inline styles with explicit monospace font - still not working for user

### Current Code State:
```tsx
// DungeonGrid.tsx - uses pre tag with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
// Explicitly sets fontFamily to 'Space Mono', 'Courier New', monospace
```

### Hypothesis:
There may be a browser-specific issue, CSS loading problem, or Next.js hydration issue that's causing the styles not to apply correctly in the user's browser.

### Next Steps to Try:
1. Check if Space Mono font is actually loading in user's browser
2. Try using a system monospace font instead of Google Fonts
3. Add CSS directly to the component instead of relying on globals.css
4. Check for Next.js hydration mismatches
5. Try a completely different rendering approach (canvas or SVG)
